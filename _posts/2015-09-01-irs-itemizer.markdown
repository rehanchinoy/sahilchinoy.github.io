I built an [open-source tool](https://github.com/sahilchinoy/django-irs-filings) to download and parse disclosure reports that some political organizations file with the IRS, then used it to create a web application to explore these filings and link to individual contributions and expenditures (inspired by [ProPublica's FEC itemizer](https://projects.propublica.org/itemizer/)).
