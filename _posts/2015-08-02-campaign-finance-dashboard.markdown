I built a web application to download and analyze federal campaign contributions. We used the system to create a series of updateable charts and dashboards for the 2016 presidential race. I also used the framework to help write a [story](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-california-campaign-money-20150717-story.html) about California's role in financing the race.
